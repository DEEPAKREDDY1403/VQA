Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems combine computer vision and natural language 
processing to generate accurate responses to image-based queries. By bridging visual and textual 
modalities, they aim to enhance answer precision, improve contextual understanding, and 
incorporate advancements like attention mechanisms and broader datasets for better performance, 
paving the way for more seamless human-computer interaction. 
These systems employ methods such as pre-trained transformer models, LSTMs, Convolutional 
Neural Networks (CNNs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and reinforcement learning. Attention 
mechanisms further refine the alignment of visual and textual inputs, enabling more accurate and 
context-aware predictions. 
The integration of the Vision-and-Language Transformer (ViLT) simplifies multimodal 
processing by directly fusing image patches and text tokens. This approach reduces computational 
complexity while improving precision, making ViLT a key component in advancing the efficiency 
and scalability of VQA systems.
